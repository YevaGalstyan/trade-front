## Important

At present, the project isn't being utilized for commercial purposes. However, it showcases compelling UI and functional solutions, alongside demonstrated implementations of packages such as: 
- [APEXCHARTS.JS](https://apexcharts.com/)
- [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/)

Furthermore, it's important to note that this repository is a duplicate of the original one used during the project's development phase, which is why the commit history is absent.
